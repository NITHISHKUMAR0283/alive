## Enhanced RAG System with Dynamic Temperature Queries

âœ… **Implemented 5 comprehensive temperature analysis queries:**
- Temperature average statistics across all profiles
- Temperature distribution by oceanographic depth zones
- Highest temperature profile identification
- Coldest temperature float analysis
- Surface vs deep temperature stratification analysis

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Improvements:**
- 389 total queries in ChromaDB (384 base + 5 dynamic)
- Enhanced semantic variations for better similarity matching
- Real schema-based SQL queries tested against 1.4M measurements
- Organized directory structure with essential files only

ðŸ“Š **System Performance:**
- All queries verified against real Parquet database
- Quality controlled data (temperature_qc = 1) only
- Geographic and temporal context in results
- Interactive testing interface ready

ðŸ”§ **Technical Stack:**
- ChromaDB vector database with optimized embeddings
- DuckDB for efficient Parquet querying
- Groq LLM integration for dynamic SQL generation
- Sentence transformers for fast local embeddings
